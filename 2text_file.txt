Create a local .gitignore

If you create a file in your repository named .gitignore,
Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore,
before you make a commit.

A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository,
in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

GitHub maintains an official list of recommended
.gitignore files for many popular operating systems,
environments, and languages in the github/gitignore public repository.

In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository.
Enter touch .gitignore to create a .gitignore file.
The Octocat has a Gist containing some good rules to add to this file.

If you already have a file checked in, and you want to ignore it,
Git will not ignore the file if you add a rule later. In those cases,
you must untrack the file first,
by running the following command in your terminal:
$ git rm --cached FILENAME
